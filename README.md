Do you ever get tired of wondering where you are, or thinking about where you need to go. Well, fear not we have the solution to all your problems. Instead of you being absolutely clueless on your whereabouts we've made a program for a Qbot that leaves it completely baffled as to its location as well as having no idea of what to do next. Leave all the stress of mapping and localising to the Qbot, so that you can blame something else the next time you get lost in Auckland.

This is the repository for our ENGMT380 project.
